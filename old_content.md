Crux 
Despite being the smallest of the 88 modern constellations, the Southern Cross is one of the most recognisable of the Southern Hemisphere, appearing on the flags of Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Samoa and Papua New Guinea.

These interpretations are from African, Australian Aboriginal, South-East Asian, Pacific Islander and South American cultures. 

Crux is located in the third quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ3) and can be seen at latitudes between +20° and -90°. 


Centaurus 
Centaurus was first depicted by Babylonians as Bison-man, associated with the Sun God Utu-Samash, then by the Greeks as a Centaur. According to Roman poet Ovid, the constellation honours Chiron, a tutor to many Greek heroes, including Heracles, Theseus and Jason.
