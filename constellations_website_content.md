# Constellations:  
**Each Description should have:**  
* How to find in sky,
* How it appears in the sky; and what it represents,
* Associated myths,
* Associated uses, present and historical,
* A brief introduction/ conclusion?

**Crux**  
This is a one of the most popular constellations in the southern skies. Its name is derived from the Latin word: Cross, and it is the smallest of the 88 modern constellations. Being such an iconic constellation, it is found among many international cultures, and is found on the Australian, New Zealand, Brazilian, Papua new Guinean, and Samoan Flags. Before the invention of satellite positioning systems, or widespread use of the compass, this constellation was used, particularly in sailing, to find the way south.
**Aquarius**  
This is a constellation of the zodiac (a constellation which appear +-8 degrees from the apparent path of the sun), and its Latin translation is cupbearer. In ancient Babylonian culture, the constellation depicts “The Great One”, which represents the god Ea. He is seen as holding an overflowing vase of water. The ancient god was associated with heavy flooding in the Babylonian culture, and attributed as the one who starts spring, by placing his vase into the River Nile, and creating an annual flood.
**Orion**  
Perhaps the easiest to find constellation in the night sky is that of Orion. The representation of this constellation is often that of Orion himself, god of Poseidon, a superhuman giant hunter, who threated to kill all the animals of Earth. The myth recounts the goddess Gaia in fury at Orion’s claim, and tried to kill him with a scorpion. According to legend, this reason is why the constellation of Scorpius and Orion can never be seen at once in the night sky.
