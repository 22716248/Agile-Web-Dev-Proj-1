                    Throughout history, cultures have represented their beliefs, experiences, and mythologies in the night sky. The International Astronomical Union accepts a list of 88 constellations, derived from the 48 traditional Greek constellations, although many cultures have entirely different astronomical distinctions. Some constellations are widely recognised, some are unique to a single place. Most prominent constellations have meanings across many cultures. Before the invention of satellite positioning systems, or the widespread use of the compass, constellations have been used for navigation, particularly in sailing.
                    <br><br>
                    It is worth covering some terminology:
                    <br>The 'zodiac' is an area of the sky extending +-8° North or South in celestial latitude of the 'eliptic' - the apparent path of the sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. The zodiac is divided into the twelve commonly known constellations.
                    <br>An 'asterism' is any recognisable celestial grouping that isn't an official constellation. For example, Orion's belt is an asterism.
                    <br>A constellation's 'zenith' is the time/place when it is highest in the sky.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, let's look at some constellations:

                        This is a one of the most popular constellations in the southern skies. Its name is derived from the Latin word: Cross, and it is the smallest of the 88 modern constellations. Being such an iconic constellation, it is found among many international cultures, and is found on the Australian, New Zealand, Brazilian, Papua New Guinean, and Samoan flags. Crux was commonly used in navigation to find the way South.

                        Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, and its Latin translation is cupbearer. In ancient Babylonian culture, the constellation is “The Great One”, the god Ea. He is seen as holding an overflowing vase of water. The ancient god was associated with heavy flooding in the Babylonian culture, and attributed as the one who starts spring, by placing his vase into the River Nile, and creating an annual flood.

                        Perhaps the easiest to find constellation in the night sky is that of Orion. The representation of this constellation is often that of Orion himself, a superhuman giant hunter, son of Poseidon, who threated to kill all the animals of Earth. The myth recounts the goddess Gaia in fury at Orion’s claim, and tried to kill him with a scorpion. According to legend, this is why the constellation of Scorpius and Orion can never be seen at once in the night sky.

                        In Greek mythology, Canis Major is Laelaps, the fastest dog in the world that will catch anything. It represents the larger of Orion's two hunting dogs, chasing Lepus the hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the bull.
                        <br><br>
                        The constellation can be found by taking Orion's belt and stretching an imaginary line through it, down and to the left. This will locate Sirius, the brightest star in the sky and home to Canis Major.

                        In the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, the Goddess Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to Kill Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is Orion, and faces Taurus as if in combat.
                        <br><br>
                        The identification of Taurus as a bull is incredibly old and universal, dating back to the Chalcolithic, possibly even the Upper Paleolithic. Taurus contains the Pleiades, known as the 'Seven Sisters' in the languages of many indigenous cultures, including those of Australia, North America, and Siberia. This means that this constellation has been identified by a common ancient origin.

                        Centaurus is one of the largest constellations in the sky. The constellation is Chiron the Centaur, a tutor to many Greek heroes, including Heracles, Theseus and Jason. It was formerly known as 'Bison-Man' to the Babylonians, associated with the Sun God Utu-Samash.
                        <br><br>
                        Centaurus is home to Alpha, Beta and Proxima Centuari. Alpha Centuari is the closest star system to our sun, and the third brightest star in the sky, making Centaurus easy to see.

                        In 1006 AD, within Lupus, the supernova SN 1006 occurred. This is the brightest stellar event in recorded history, and would have been clearly visible during daytime.
                        <br><br>
                        Lupus is located in the third quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ3) and can be seen at latitudes between +35° and -90°.

                        The bow of Sagittarius stands poised towards the star Antares, the heart of Scorpius, if it should ever attack Hercules. Sagittarius is represented in Greek mythology as Chiron, tutor of Jason, and Crotus, the inventor of archery. Sagittarius is Latin for 'archer' and one of the 12 Zodiac.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1977, the Big Ear radio telescope observed a strong narrowband radio signal from within Sagittarius. The 'Wow!' signal 
                        has been used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmissed ever detected.
                        <br><br>
                        Sagittarius is near the densest spot of the Milky Way, the galactic center. Because of this, Sagittarius is home to many star clusters and nebulae.

                        The Argo Navis is a ship that appears to sail down the 'river of the Milky Way'; Sailed by Jason and the Argonauts to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece. The Argo Navis was by far the largest constellation before it was divided by Nicolas Louis de Lacille into the three modern constellations: Carina (the hull), Vela (the sails), and Puppis (the poop deck).

                        Also known as: 'the Boat' to the Vedic; and Te Waka-o-Tamarereti (the canoe of Tamarereti) to the Māori. All the stars of the Argo Navis are visible from the tropics Southward, with the zenith at Southern temperate latitudes. The brightest of the ship's stars is Canopus, the second brightest star in the sky.
