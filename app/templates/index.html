                    This is a one of the most popular constellations in the southern skies. Its name is derived from the Latin word: Cross,
                     and it is the smallest of the 88 modern constellations. Being such an iconic constellation, it is found among many international cultures,
                      and is found on the Australian, New Zealand, Brazilian, Papua new Guinean, and Samoan Flags. Before the invention of satellite positioning systems, 
                      or widespread use of the compass, this constellation was used, particularly in sailing, to find the way south.

                    This is a constellation of the zodiac (a constellation which appear +-8 degrees from the apparent path of the sun), and its Latin translation is cupbearer. 
                    In ancient Babylonian culture, the constellation depicts “The Great One”, which represents the god Ea. He is seen as holding an overflowing vase of water. 
                    The ancient god was associated with heavy flooding in the Babylonian culture, and attributed as the one who starts spring, by placing his vase into the River Nile, 
                    and creating an annual flood.

                    Perhaps the easiest to find constellation in the night sky is that of Orion. The representation of this constellation is often that of Orion himself, 
                    god of Poseidon, a superhuman giant hunter, who threated to kill all the animals of Earth. The myth recounts the goddess Gaia in fury at Orion’s claim,
                     and tried to kill him with a scorpion. According to legend, this reason is why the constellation of Scorpius and Orion can never be seen at once in the night sky.

                    Centaurus was first depicted by Babylonians as Bison-man, associated with the Sun God Utu-Samash, 
                    then by the Greeks as a Centaur. According to Roman poet Ovid, the constellation honours Chiron, a
                     tutor to many Greek heroes, including Heracles, Theseus and Jason. One of the largest constellations 
                     in the sky, centaurus is home to Alpha Centuari and Beta Centuari, which make a triple star system with
                     Proxima Centuari. Alpha Centuari is the third brightest star in the sky, and the closest star system to our sun.

                    In ancient times, Lupus (Latin for 'wolf') was considered to be the an animal being hunted or killed by centaurus. Although ancient, it has no mythological assosication.
                    In 1006 AD, within Lupus, the supernova SN 1006 occurred. This is brightest stellar event in recorded history, and would have been clearly visible during daytime.
                    Lupus is the 46th constellation in size. It is located in the third quadrant of the southern hemisphere (SQ3) and can be seen at latitudes between +35° and -90°.

                    Sagittarius, Latin for 'archer' and one of the 12 Zodiac, was first identified by the Babylonians, and adopted by the Greeks. 
                    It is conflicted whether it is Chiron, tutor of Jason, or Crotus, the inventor of archery. 
                    The bow of the constellation stands poised towards the star Antares, the heart of Scorpius, if Scorpius should ever attack Hercules.
                    On August 15, 1977, the Big Ear radio telescope observed a strong narrowband radio signal. Known as the 'Wow!' signal, 
                    it was used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmissed ever detected.
                    Sagittarius is near the densest spot of the Milky Way, the galactic center. Because of this, Sagittarius is home to many star clusters and nebulae.

                    In Greek myth, Scorpius is the scorpion sent to kill Orion the hunter, and is a reminder for mortals to be mindful of their hubris.
                    The scorpion is also recognised in Oceanic cultures: The Javanese of Indonesia recognise it as 'Banyakangrem' - 'the brooded sawn' or 'Kalapa Doyong' - 
                    'leaning coconut tree'; In Hawaii it is the demigod Maui's fishhook - 'Ka Makau Nui o Māui' - 'the Big Fishhook of Māui'.

                    In Greek mythology, Canis Major is known to be associated with Laelaps the fastest dog in the world that will catch anything. 
                    It represents the larger of Orion's two hunting dogs who follows the hunter as he hunts the hare Lepus.
                    The constellation can be found by taking Orion's belt and stretching an imaginary line through it, down and to the left. This will locate Sirius,
                     the brightest star in the sky and home to Canis Major. Canis Major is the 43rd biggest constellation in the sky.
